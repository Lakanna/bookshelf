## Problems addressed by the developed application:

1. This website allows users to select a book of their choice. Books can be
   found in the bestseller list or in the category of interest.
2. By clicking on a chosen book, users can view additional information about it
   and add it to their shopping list.
3. A highlight of the site is the ability to instantly order a book from an
   online store. This can be done by following the link on the book card or in
   the shopping list.
